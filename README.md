# Ema-Intern-Take-Home-Challenge




Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Query Agent capable of answering simple questions based on a small set of lecture notes and a table of LLM architectures. The system should generate conversational and abstractive responses, utilizing LLMs and open-source vector indexing and storage frameworks.

Plan
Data Preparation:

Collect and preprocess the provided lecture notes and LLM architectures table.
Organize the raw data into a structured format suitable for vector indexing and LLM consumption.
Vector Indexing:

Use an open-source framework like LangChain or Llama-Index to create vector embeddings of the processed data.
Store the embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
Query Processing:

Implement a pipeline that takes a natural language query and retrieves relevant embeddings from the vector database.
Use a pre-trained LLM to generate a conversational answer based on the retrieved data.
Answer Generation:

Fine-tune the answer generation process to ensure relevance and coherence.
Implement citation of references from the lecture notes to support the generated answers.
Documentation:

Document the approach, including data organization, model selection, and system architecture.
Provide a README file with instructions on setting up and running the system.
Optional Enhancements:

Implement conversational memory to handle follow-up questions.
Develop a system to generate summaries of conversation sessions.
Implementation
1. Data Preparation
Lecture Notes and LLM Architectures Table
Convert the lecture notes and table into a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
Tokenize and clean the text data to remove any irrelevant information.
2. Vector Indexing
LangChain or Llama-Index
Use LangChain or Llama-Index to create vector embeddings of the text data.
Store the embeddings in a vector database like FAISS or Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
3. Query Processing
Pipeline Implementation
Implement a pipeline that takes a natural language query and retrieves relevant embeddings from the vector database.
Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate a conversational answer based on the retrieved data.
4. Answer Generation
Fine-tuning and Citations
Fine-tune the answer generation process to ensure relevance and coherence.
Implement a method to cite references from the lecture notes to support the generated answers.
5. Documentation
README and Instructions
Document the approach, including data organization, model selection, and system architecture.
Provide a README file with instructions on setting up and running the system.
6. Optional Enhancements
Conversational Memory and Summaries
Implement conversational memory to handle follow-up questions.
Develop a system to generate summaries of conversation sessions.
Conclusion
The proposed approach leverages existing frameworks and models to build a functional Natural Language Query Agent. The focus is on creating a robust pipeline for data processing, vector indexing, and answer generation. Optional enhancements like conversational memory and session summaries can further improve the system's capabilities.

Sample Implementation Outline
Here’s an outline of how the implementation can be structured:

Data Preparation Script (data_preparation.py)

Load and preprocess lecture notes and LLM architectures table.
Save the structured data in a suitable format.
Vector Indexing Script (vector_indexing.py)

Create vector embeddings using LangChain or Llama-Index.
Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone).
Query Processing Script (query_processing.py)

Implement a pipeline for natural language query processing.
Retrieve relevant embeddings and generate answers using a pre-trained LLM.
Answer Generation Script (answer_generation.py)

Fine-tune answer generation and implement citation of references.
Main Application Script (app.py)

Integrate all components and provide a user interface for querying.
Documentation (README.md)

Detailed instructions on setting up and running the system.
